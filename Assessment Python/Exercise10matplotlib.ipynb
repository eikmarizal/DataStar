    "\n",
    "This problem uses data from the [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/), a popular repository for machine learning datasets. In particular, we will be using the \"Individual household electric power consumption Data Set\" which can be downloaded from the link given below:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset:** [Electric power consumption](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip) [20Mb]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description:** Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken from the UCI web site:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Date:** Date in format dd/mm/yyyy\n",
    "2. **Time:** time in format hh:mm:ss\n",
    "3. **Global_active_power:** household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)\n",
    "4. **Global_reactive_power:** household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)\n",
    "5. **Voltage:** minute-averaged voltage (in volt)\n",
    "6. **Global_intensity:** household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)\n",
    "7. **Sub_metering_1:** energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).\n",
    "8. **Sub_metering_2:** energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.\n",
    "9. **Sub_metering_3:** energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.\n",

    "### Loading the data\n",
    "\n",
    "When loading the dataset, please consider the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset has 2,075,259 rows and 9 columns. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, we will only be using data from the dates 2007-02-01 and 2007-02-02. One alternative is to read the data from just those dates rather than reading in the entire dataset and subsetting to those dates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Making Plots\n",
    "\n",
    "Our overall goal here is simply to examine how household energy usage varies over a 2-day period in February, 2007. Your task is to reconstruct the following plots below, all of which were constructed using the matplotlib plotting system.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each plot you should\n",
