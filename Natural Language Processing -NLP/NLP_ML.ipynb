    "NLP is a branch of data science that consists of systematic processes for analyzing, understanding, and deriving information from the text data in a smart and efficient manner. By utilizing NLP and its components, one can organize the massive chunks of text data, perform numerous automated tasks and solve a wide range of problems such as – automatic summarization, machine translation, named entity recognition, relationship extraction, sentiment analysis, speech recognition, and topic segmentation etc.\n",

       "\"I own 2 of these, one is international version that I used during travels and another is T-Mobile's.T-Mobile's came with Android 2.3.5 and international one with 2.3.6, I liked 2.3.6 more, less glitchesand runs smoother,also battery efficient. Anyway,T-mobile applies a software update pretty right awayand now both run the same version. International has faster cpu (1.5Ghz) vs T-Mobile's 1Ghz, thoughhonestly I don't feel difference. I don't run games and use the usual set of applications - Google'sGmail,Maps,Talk, Facebook's client and messenger, Skype (which is not officially supported on SamsungExhibit / Wonder but works great) and few other social networking / informational apps. T-Mobile activationwas a blaze.What I like: screen is nice except in sunny places, surprisingly clear for TFT however my eyes like AMOLEDmore. Size is great if you can live with smaller screen. CPU speed is superb for both 1Ghz and 1.5Ghz. Battery lifeis fantastic.What I don't like: TFT screen,don't see anything in particular conditions (direct sun etc). Small size means lesscomfortable keyboard.Overall very nice smartphone for its price if you're ready to give up on screen size and quality.\""
